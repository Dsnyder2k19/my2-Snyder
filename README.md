### Favorite Vacation Spot: California
I recently visited California a few weeks ago and it has became one of
my favorite vacation spots. I went on this trip to meet up with some
**friends** who live down there. We drove around most of the **LA** area and
later on drove down to **Santa Barbara**. It was cool to be able to see
Hollywood Bld, it was a little trashy though, and I loved touring universal 
studios. We drove down to Santa Barbara to visit even more friends that live
down there and the weather in Santa Barbara is always perfect since its always
around 70F. The ocean and beaches were a fun experience, I got to go kayaking
on the ocean, which was nerve-racking for me at first until I realized sharks
wouldn't attack me. The food was great too, there wasn't a place we ate at that 
I didn't like. Overall the trip was a great experience because I was able to meet
up with longtime friends, eat great food, and visit many cool places.
