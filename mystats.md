One of the most interesting facts about me is that I was an uncle before
I was even born. I have 4 nieces and 3 nephews ranging from ages of 27 years
old to 2 years old. I recently flew by myself to california to visit some friends
for a week. I have visited almost 30 of the states, never have been out of the
country though. My favorite flavor of ice cream is vanilla.
